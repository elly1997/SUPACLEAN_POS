# SUPACLEAN POS — Desktop, Phone & Terminal

The POS is a **single, responsive app** that works on:

- **Desktop** — Full layout with sidebar. Use mouse and keyboard as usual.
- **Phone** — Hamburger menu (☰) opens the sidebar; tap outside to close. Touch-friendly.
- **POS terminals / tablets** — Same UI. Use fullscreen (F11) or kiosk mode if you run it on a dedicated device.

**No special “POS mode”** — one layout adapts to screen size. Use it on any device; the same URL works everywhere.

For setup and running the app, see `SETUP_GUIDE.md` and `START_APPLICATION.md`.
